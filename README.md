# 💼 Machine Learning Internship Projects – CODSOFT
This repository contains the machine learning projects completed as part of my **Internship At CODSOFT**. Each project demonstrates practical implementations of ML techniques for solving real-world problems, including classification, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics.



## 📁 Projects Overview

📌 Tasks Completed
### ✅ Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
**Objective:** Predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using natural language processing (NLP).

**Techniques Used:**

-Text vectorization (TF-IDF)

-Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression

-Model evaluation using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix

**Dataset:** Custom dataset with movie titles, plots, and genres

**Outcome:** Built a text classification model that can determine a movie's genre from its plot.

### ✅ Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective:** Identify fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.

**Techniques Used:**

-Data preprocessing and scaling

-Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost

-ROC-AUC score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for evaluation

**Dataset:** Kaggle’s Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset (anonymized features)

**Outcome:** Developed models that can effectively detect fraud with high recall, even on imbalanced data.

### ✅ Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

**Objective:** Predict whether a customer will leave a telecom service based on historical behavior and demographics.

**Techniques Used:**

-Data encoding and feature engineering

-Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest

-Evaluation via accuracy, precision, and classification report

**Dataset:** Telco customer churn dataset

**Outcome:** Built a reliable model to predict churn, helping businesses retain valuable customers.

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
